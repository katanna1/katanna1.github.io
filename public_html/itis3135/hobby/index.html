                <p>Despite their popularity, several of these disciplines are not even recognized by the USEF (United States Equestrian Federation).

                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>Competitions are not a mandatory aspect of equestrianism, which is why it can be considered as both a <i>hobby and sport</i>. This section 
                    will expand on horseback riding competitions on an international level, in the <strong>Olympics</strong>.

                <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
                <p>Due to this specific lens, this section will not include any events of the Western discipline, as the Olympics only have English riding events. 
                    However, there are just as many popular and high-level Western competitions. If you would like to learn more about competing in Western horseback riding 
                    events, please click <a href="https://www.aqha.com/disciplines/showing/start-showing/showing-classes/western">here</a>. In the United States, the AQHA (American 
                    Quarter Horse Association) organizes many well known Western competitions.

                    <h4>Dressage</h4>
                        <p>
                            The dressage event, popularly nicknamed <i>equestrian ballet</i>, is the most advanced form of horse training. In this event, the horse and rider duo preform 
                            intricate and artistic movements to the rhythm of their chosen music. This event is composed of both individual and team competitions, each with its own set of medals.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Olympic dressage judges take into account the elegance, ease, and fludity of the movements. Throughout the event, the horse must show the three paces, which are: walk, trot, and canter.
                            Some movements are predetermined in the competition, meaning every athlete must somehow incorporate these into their performance. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>An important aspect of this sport, especially in this event, is teamwork between the horse and rider. The manuevers required at this level are very technical, and require 
                            immense amounts of training. But, a primary goal of dressage is to make the perfomance look easy and natural, like the rider is simply sitting on top of a horse who decided to 
                            do ballet moves.
                        </p><br>
