        Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is

        Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is
        <u style="color:purple;">Chill out, what ya yellin' for?</u>
        Lay back, it's all been done before
        And if, you could only let it be, you will see
        I like you the way you are
        When we're driving in your car
        And you're talking to me one on one, but you become
        Somebody else
        'Round everyone else
        You're watching your back
        Like you can't relax
        You try to be cool
        You look like a fool to me
        Tell me
        Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
        I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
        Gets me frustrated
        Life's like this, you
        And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
        And you take what you get, and you turn it into
        Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you faking
        No, no, no
        You come over unannounced
        Dressed up like you're somethin' else
        Where you are and where it's at you see
        You're making me
        Laugh out when you strike your pose
        Take off all your preppy clothes
        You know you're not fooling anyone
        When you become
        Somebody else
        'Round everyone else
        You're watching your back
        Like you can't relax
        You try to be cool
        You look like a fool to me
        Tell me
        Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
