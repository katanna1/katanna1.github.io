            <h3>The Artist</h3>
            <p>
                Ngoai (Nami) Siu attended and graduated from NC Nails Academy in 2019. Since then, she has had consistent work in a variety of nail 
                salons around Charlotte. She is extremely passionate about art, and has been drawing and painting from a young age. The progression to do 
                nail art as a career was very natural, and is a great outlet for her creativity and artistic talents. Nami is kind, patient, and very knowledgable 
                about her craft. She has strong connections with several long term clients because of her amazing personality and beautiful work.
