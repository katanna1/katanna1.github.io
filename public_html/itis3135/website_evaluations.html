                <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
                <h3>High-Quality: <a target="_blank" href ="https://www.sephora.com/">Sephora</a></h3>
                <h4>General Description of Website:</h4>
                <p>Sephora's website is what one would expect from a makeup company, especially from such a popular and large corporation. The background color of the homepage is 
                    just a simple white, as is the header and top navigation/search bar. Right under the lower navigation bar, which is fully black, there are ads for current promotions and new 
                    arrivals. These are all different colors, but they are all vibrant, colorful, and bright, which sticks out on the plain white background. Under that, there are 
                    more advertisements for products, but these are relatively much more dull. They just include pictures of the products and their names, all on a white background, 
                    and just seprated by a boxed border, with a slight shadow. <br><br>
                    The font is a simple serif font, that is used throughout the whole site. The only variations in this come from the size of the text, or the fonts weight.
                    There is not any text that is not seprated from the rest of the page, by a box that has a different color, or a slight shadow border. Also, the homepage itself is 
                    very long. To get to the bottom of the page, where the footer is, users have to scroll by a lot of products and advertisements. The footer itself, like the lower 
                    navigation bar, is fully black, with white text. Looking back at that black navigation bar, it goes across the whole page, and has several main groups. Then, when users 
                    hover over one of those groups, a large drop down menu comes up, with a huge variety of subgroups. Though there is a lot of information when the dropdown comes up, it 
                    is organized well with titles organzing all of those subgroups together.
                </p>
                
                <h4>CRAP Design Principles:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Make elements <em>different</em> to increase understanding. All elements on a page should 
                        have enought contrast so that they are easily distinguishable from one another. This principle is essential for 
                        usability and accessibility reasons. However, this principle is not limited only to contrasting colors. Other factors such as 
                        size, distance, white space, shade, and even shape can help create contrast between elements on a page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Repeat visual elements to create <em>strong unity</em>. Intentional recurrence of a specific element in a 
                        design can help tie everything together, and makes it look like it actually belongs together. To acheive a coherent look, designers 
                        can use the same colors, fonts, and shapes throughout the whole website. This makes navigation much easier for users, when all elements 
                        are predictable and repetitive. </li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Place elements deliberately and rationally to improve clarity. This principle includes everything from text 
                        alignment, to the placement of images and other visual elements. Arranging elements on your webpage in a <em>organized manner</em> can make your site 
                        look much more professional, and will make it easier for users to scan the site quickly. With a well-aligned website, users attention will immediately 
                        go to the main message, which is an essential goal in design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Place related items together to <em>convey relationships</em>. This also works the other way, to distinguish unrelated items 
                        designers should increase distance between them. Applying this principle correctly helps reduce clutter on the page, and makes it easier 
                        for users to navigate the page, and find what they are looking for. Proximity can be acheived by using white space, lists, and other 
                        design elements. This is a powerful principle, and when not careful, procimity can overpower the other three CRAP principles, due to ingrained 
                        perception, which creates a much stronger effect than other visual features, such as color, shape, brightness, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Final Assesment:</h4>
                <p>Sephora's website follows all of the CRAP principles very well. The site repeats many visual features throughout, making all pages fit together, 
                    and look overall coherent. Additionally, they are aware of the importance of contrast, and use infrequent splashes of color, on a basic white background, 
                    to draw users attention, exactly where they want it. And because they have so many different products, their use of proximity principles is very helpful for 
                    users to be able to navigate throughout the site, and find exactly what they want. Relationships between elements are very evident, and vice versa. Finally, the 
                    site has an organized alignment, basically a grid going throughout the page, again making it much easier for users to navigate and find what they came to find. Overall, 
                    it is evident that Sephora's site designers are aware of the importance of design principles, and how they can help make life easier for users, helping them acheive 
                    the companies main goal, maximize profit. You cannot sell anything if users cannot find anything!

                <h3>Low-Quality: <a target="_blank" href ="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
                <h4>General Description of Website:</h4>
                <p>Yale's School of Art website is <em>not at all</em> what one would expect from a prominent universities art program. When user first access the homepage they are accosted by 
                    highlighter yellow and a wide array of random animations. The background is mainly black, but it has the name of the website, in a wavy rainbow font, repeated frequently. Below the 
                    title, there is a disclaimer which says that the website is an "ongoing collaborative experience," where anyone at the school can edit the content, which obviously explaines the state 
                    of the site. The navigation bar is on the left side of the site (and not visible when the page is not in full screen). Every section from this navigation bar has a different background 
                    and color scheme. When users scroll down, the chaos continues, with random boxes of information and events thrown around. The only information on the footer is the the disclaimer mentioned 
                    previously again, with a highlighter orange color. Overall, my eyes cannot handle looking at this for more than a minute, it gave me a headache.
                </p>
                
                <h4>CRAP Design Principles: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Make elements <em>different</em> to increase understanding (explained more in depth in first section).</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Repeat visual elements to create <em>strong unity</em> (explained more in depth in first section).</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Place elements deliberately and rationally to improve <em>clarity</em> (explained more in depth in first section).</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Place related items together to <em>convey relationships</em> (explained more in depth in first section).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Final Assesment:</h4>
                <p>Yale's School of Art website does not follow the CRAP principles well at all. The whole site lacks any repetition of colors, fonts, shapes, or anything 
                    other than chaotic visuals. There is contrast on the website, as all the text is displayed in a box that has some ugly background color. However, all of these 
                    boxes, have the same proximity to one another, despite if they are related or not. There is technically alignement, as all of the random boxes are on 2/3 of the 
                    screen. But this being the left side, leaves a huge amount of whitespace on the right side, which shows more of the throwup background that is chosen for that specific 
                    page. It is cute that they decided to do this collaborative art for their website, but considering it is the first thing that pops up when you type in "Yale School of Art," 
                    it is honestly a pretty bad look for the art school. They could have at least made it not their main website, so they could showcase some of the student projects that they 
                    are acutally proud of, and showcase the quality of their education.
